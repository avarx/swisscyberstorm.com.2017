In the past, private users could only access a fraction of what is available in Hacking-Lab. Most of the challenges were only available to universities, companies and organizations. Many private users were asking us if we could provide more content for them. That's why the Hacking-Lab created the membership feature.

### How does it work?

Simply register for the new event named "HL MEMBER EVENT 2017", and pay the fee which is EUR 49. The Hacking-Lab accepts PayPal.

### What do you get?

You get access to an exclusive membership event with 12 challenges. In addition to that, you get the membership status for one year. With this status, you profit from additional goodies.
